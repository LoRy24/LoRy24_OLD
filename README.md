# Hi! I'm **LoRy24** 👋

I'm a young student that ❤️ programming in ☕️ Java & C#. I made some interesting projects that you can see in my repositories 📄 page. I'm also learning 📘 C and C++ (I already did an interesting project with a friend of mine, **BatchMaker**)

## So, which projects i made?
I'm not a real PRO of Java or other languages, so I didn't make a lot of projects 😕 ... But I made some intresting softwares such like 
[Mandelbrot](https://github.com/LoryTheRock24/MandelbrotSet) or [PasswordGenerator](https://github.com/LoryTheRock24/PasswordGenerator). And i also made some videogames, [Triangoll2](https://github.com/LoryTheRock24/PasswordGenerator) and [Jebab](https://github.com/LoryTheRock24/PasswordGenerator).
